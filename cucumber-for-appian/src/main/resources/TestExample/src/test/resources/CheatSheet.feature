Feature: Cucumber for Appian Cheatsheet
  This feature file is intended as a cheatsheet of supported functions. The
  scenarios are not structured as valid test cases and are not intended to be
  run as is.

  While the examples use "Given...", you can use any standard Gherkin
  keywords e.g. When, Then, And...

  When using these examples you will will also need to replace the quoted
  placeholder or data table with actual parameters. e.g.
    Given I click on menu "TEMPO_MENU_NAME"
  should be replaced with:
    Given I click on menu "Actions"

  If the same label is used for multiple fields, tasks, records, etc. in the
  same interface, indexing is necessary. In order to select the second iteration
  of the same label, use LABEL[2].
